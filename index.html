<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Increasingly, humanities scholars (and scholars in humanistic social sciences) recognize the value of digital research tools and methods such as text-mining and spatial analysis. As more content is digitized these methods are becoming more useful, especially to graduate students who are at a formative stage in their careers. However, even if these researchers assemble a collection of digitized resources, these resources may not be in a format that is conducive to digital methods. To address these needs, the UCLA Library has established Digital Research Start-Up Partnerships (DResSUP) to introduce graduate students to the tools and methods central to current digital research practices. Embracing a project-based approach with an emphasis on workflow, process, and prototyping, students are taught how to realize their projects through their own work in an "incubator" environment alongside a cohort of their graduate student peers and with guidance from instructors.
